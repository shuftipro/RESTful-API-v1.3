# Off-site Verification with OCR

This *Offsite verification with OCR* requires zero interaction between the provider and the end-user. Merchant collects the image or video proofs from end-users and sends them to us via RESTful API. In the verification request, Merchant specifies the keys for the parameters to be verified. Shufti Pro extracts the values against each of those keys from the proofs provided by the Merchant. Next, Shufti Pro’s intelligently driven system verifies the provided documents for authenticity.

**Shufti Pro’s AI & HI hybrid technology ensures 99.6% accurate results and quickest response time.**

# Authorization

The Shufti Pro Verification API authenticates clients with a **Basic Auth** header. Provide your **Client ID as Username** and **Secret Key as Password**. This header is required in every request that will be made to the API.

Fields               | Required | Description
---------------------|----------|-------------
username             | Yes      | Enter Client ID as username.
password             | Yes      | Enter your Secret Key as password.

# Verification Request

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/c371b72a229cc0083420)

Whenever a request for verification from a user is received, Shufti Pro’s intelligent system determines the nature of verification through parameters given below. These parameters enable Shufti Pro to:

1. Identify its customers

2. Check authenticity of client’s credentials

3. Read client’s data

4. Decide what information is being sent to perform that verification 

# Request Parameters

It is important to note here that each service module is independent of other and each one of them is activated according to the nature of request received from you. There are a total of six services which include face, document, address, consent, phone and background_checks.

All verification services are optional. You can provide Shufti Pro a single service or mixture of several services for verifications. All keys are optional too. If a key is given in document or address sevice and no value is provided then OCR will be performed for those keys. 

* ## reference

	Required: **Yes**  
	Type: **string**  
	Minimum: **6 characters**  
	Maximum: **250 characters**

	This is the unique reference ID of request, which we will send you back with each response, so you can verify the request. Only alphanumeric values are allowed. This reference can be used to get status of already performed verification requests.


* ## country

	Required: **Yes**  
	Type: **string**  
	Length: **2 characters**

	You may omit this parameter if you don't want to enforce country verification. If a valid country code is provided, then the proofs for document verification or address verification must be from the same country. Country code must be a valid [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) country code. Please consult Supported Countries for country codes.

* ## language

	Required: **No**   
	Type: **string**  
	Length: **2 characters**

	Send the 2 characters long language code of your preferred language to display the verification screens accordingly. Please consult [Supported Languages](languages.md) for language codes. Default language english will be selected if this key is missing in the request.

* ## email

	Required: **Yes**  
	Type: **string**  
	Minimum: **6 characters**  
	Maximum: **128 characters**

	This field represents email of the end-user. If it is missing in a request, than Shuftpro will ask the user for its email in an on-site request.

* ## callback_url

	Required: **Yes**  
	Type: **string**  
	Minimum: **6 characters**  
	Maximum: **250 characters**

	During a verification request, we make several server to server calls to keep you updated about the verification state. This way you can update the request status at your end even if the customer is lost midway through the process.

* ## verification_mode

	Required: **No**  
	Type: **string**  
	Accepted Values: **any, image_only, video_only**

	Verification mode defines what types of proofs are allowed for a verification. In case of 'video_only' mode, you can only send base64 of videos where format should be MP4 or MOV in proofs. In 'any' mode mixture of images and videos can be provided in proofs.

* ## show_results

	Required: **No**  
	Type: **string**  
	Accepted Values: **0, 1**  
	Default Values: **1**  

	If Value for this parameter is 1, verification result will be displayed to the end user, showing them whether their verification is accepted or declined. If the value of this parameter is set 0, verification results will not be shown to end-user and a `request.received` callback will be returned in case of a valid verification.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
* ## face

	The easiest of all verifications is done by authenticating the face of the users. In case of on-site verification, end-user will have to show their face in front of a webcam or camera of their phone that essentially makes it a selfie verification. If the mode of verification is off-site, then the image will be provided by you and Shufti Pro will verify that image.

	* <h3>proof</h3>

	Required: **Yes**  
	Type: **string**  
	Image Format: **JPG, JPEG, PNG, PDF** Maximum: **16MB**  
	Video Format: **MP4/MOV** Maximum: **20MB**

	Provide valid **BASE64** encoded string. Leave empty for an on-site verification.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
* ## document

	Shufti Pro provides document verification through various types of documents. The supported formats are passports, ID Cards, driving licenses and debit/credit cards. You can opt for more than 1 document type as well.  

	In case of off-site verification, you can provide more than 1 document image and use “additional proof” parameter for this. This is to ensure that the required credentials are easily visible e.g. a document might have name and image of individual at the front but the date of birth of that person is printed at the back of the document or on another page of the passport. If you opt for both facial and document verification, face of individual from document will be used to validate uploaded selfie.

	* <h3>proof</h3>

	Required: **Yes**  
	Type: **string**  
	Image Format: **JPG, JPEG, PNG, PDF** Maximum: **16MB**  
	Video Format: **MP4/MOV** Maximum: **20MB**

	Provide valid **BASE64** encoded string. Leave empty for an on-site verification.

	* <h3>additional_proof</h3>

	Required: **No**  
	Type: **string**  
	Image Format: **JPG, JPEG, PNG, PDF** Maximum: **16MB**  
	Video Format: **MP4/MOV** Maximum: **20MB**

	Provide valid **BASE64** encoded string. Leave empty for an on-site verification.

	* <h3>supported_types</h3>

	Required: **Yes**  
	Type: **Array**

	Document verification have two parameters: proof and additional_proof. If these two are not set or empty, it means that it should be an on-site verification. You can provide any one, two or more types of documents to verify the identity of user. For example, if you opt for both passport and driving license, then your user will be given an opportunity to verify data from either of these two documents. **Please provide only one document type if you are providing proof of that document with the request**. All supported types are listed below.

## Verification Response

The Shufti Pro Verification API will send you two types of responses if a request for verification is made. First is the HTTP response sent against your request, and the second is the callback response. Both HTTP and callback responses will be in the JSON format with header `application/json`. The response header also includes a key Signature. This key is used for validating the source of response. Be sure to validate the request by [generating signature](#response-signature) and matching it with Signature value from the response header.  
Responses will contain the following parameters:

* <h3>reference</h3>
	Your unique request reference, which you provided us at the time of request, so that you can identify the response in relation to the request made.

* <h3>event</h3>
	This is the request event which shows status of request. Event is changed in every response.

{
    "reference":"17374217",
    "event":"request.pending",

}
```


## Response Signature
Every HTTP and Callback responses will be in application/json with a key **Signature** in the header. It can be used to validate the source of the request. Make a signature using the following procedure:

1. Concatinate Secret Key at the end of the response string. (i.e. response + secret_key).
2. Take **SHA256** of concatinated string.
3. Match the SHA256 string with **Signature** value from the header of the response.

In short, make signature as `hash('sha256', response . your_secret_key)` and match it with the signature provided in the header in **Signature** key.


## Status Response

The Shufti Pro Verification API will send a JSON response if a status request is made. Make sure to validate the request by [generating signature](#response-signature) and matching it with **Signature** value from response header.

* <h3>reference</h3>
	Your unique request reference, which you provided us at the time of request, so that you can identify the response in relation to the request made.

* <h3>event</h3>
	This is the request event which shows status of request. Event is changed in every response.  
	  
	Please consult [Events](status_codes.md#events) for more information.

* <h3>proof</h3>
	This contains all the proofs that were used to verify data. The Proof URLs returned are temporary and valid for **15 minutes only**.

* <h3>verification_data</h3>
	This contains all the data used for verification. This will only be returned in case of `verification.accepted` or `verification.declined`.

* <h3>verification_result</h3>
	This is the complete result of the verification. 1 stands for verified, 0 for not verified and null for no verification performed. This will only be returned in case of `verification.accepted` or `verification.declined`.

* <h3>declined_reason</h3>
	This key will only be returned when event is verification.declined. This will contain the reason why `verification was declined`.

# HTTP Status Codes and Events

Instant Capture & Verification API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Every response is generated in JSON with a specific HTTP code. Go to [Status Codes](status_codes.md) for a complete list of status codes. Events are sent in responses which show the status of request. These events are sent in both HTTP and callback responses. Please consult [Events](status_codes.md#events) for a complete list of events.



# Test IDs
Shufti Pro provides the users with a number of test documents. Customers may use these to test the demo, instead of presenting their actual information. <br><br>
