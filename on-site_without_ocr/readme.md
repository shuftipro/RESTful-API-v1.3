# On-site Verification without OCR

This *Onsite verification without OCR* requires direct interaction between the provider and the end-user. We collect the image or video proofs from end-users. Merchant collects the values for selected parameters from the end-user. In the verification request, Merchant specifies the keys and values for the parameters to be verified. Shufti Pro uses a unique *template matching technique* to match these values to the data on identity documents. Next, Shufti Pro’s intelligently driven system verifies the collected documents for authenticity.

**Shufti Pro’s AI & HI hybrid technology ensures 99.6% accurate results and quickest response time.**

# Authorization

The Shufti Pro Verification API authenticates clients with a **Basic Auth** header. Provide your **Client ID as Username** and **Secret Key as Password**. This header is required in every request that will be made to the API.

Fields               | Required | Description
---------------------|----------|-------------
username             | Yes      | Enter Client ID as username.
password             | Yes      | Enter your Secret Key as password.

# Verification Request

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/7f5d45e62f3b216d9069)

Whenever a request for verification from a user is received, Shufti Pro’s intelligent system determines the nature of verification through parameters given below. These parameters enable Shufti Pro to:

1. Identify its customers

2. Check authenticity of client’s credentials

3. Read client’s data

4. Decide what information is being sent to perform that verification 

# Request Parameters

It is important to note here that each service module is independent of other and each one of them is activated according to the nature of request received from you. There are a total of six services which include face, document, address, consent, phone and background_checks.

All verification services are optional. You can provide Shufti Pro a single service or mixture of several services for verifications. All keys are optional too but values are required with the given keys.  

* ## reference

	Required: **Yes** Type: **string** Minimum: **6 characters** Maximum: **250 characters**

	This is the unique reference ID of request, which we will send you back with each response, so you can verify the request. Only alphanumeric values are allowed. This reference can be used to get status of already performed verification requests.


* ## country

	Required: **Yes** Type: **string** Length: **2 characters**

	You may omit this parameter if you don't want to enforce country verification. If a valid country code is provided, then the proofs for document verification or address verification must be from the same country. Country code must be a valid [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) country code. Please consult Supported Countries for country codes.

* ## language

	Required: **No**  
	Type: **string**  
	Length: **2 characters**

	Send the 2 characters long language code of your preferred language to display the verification screens accordingly. Please consult [Supported Languages](languages.md) for language codes. Default language english will be selected if this key is missing in the request.

* ## email

	Required: **No**  
	Type: **string**  
	Minimum: **6 characters**  
	Maximum: **128 characters**

	This field represents email of the end-user. If it is missing in a request, than Shuftpro will ask the user for its email in an on-site request.

* ## callback_url

	Required: **Yes**  
	Type: **string**  
	Minimum: **6 characters**  
	Maximum: **250 characters**

	During a verification request, we make several server to server calls to keep you updated about the verification state. This way you can update the request status at your end even if the customer is lost midway through the process.

* ## redirect_url

	Required: **No**  
	Type: **string**  
	Minimum: **6 characters**  
	Maximum: **250 characters**

	Once an on-site verification is complete, User is redirected to this link after showing the results.

* ## verification_mode

	Required: **No**  
	Type: **string**  
	Accepted Values: **any, image_only, video_only**

	Verification mode defines what types of proofs are allowed for a verification. In case of 'video_only' user will upload videos and images if verification mode is 'image_only'.

* ## allow_offline

	Required: **No**  
	Type: **string**  
	Accepted Values: **0, 1**  
	Default Values: **1**  

	This parameter allows users to upload images or videos in case of nonavailability of a functional webcam.If value: 0, users can capture photos/videos with the camera only.	

* ## show_consent

	Required: **No**  
	Type: **string**  
	Accepted Values: **0, 1**  
	Default Values: **1**

	This parameter displays a screen to collect consent from end-user before the verification process starts. If the value is set 1, the screen will be displayed to end-user. If the value is set 0, the consent screen will not be displayed. Under the GDPR, we are bound to get user’s consent therefore the default value is 1 but you can set it to 0 if you’ve already acquired the user’s consent for this biometric verification.

* ## show_privacy_policy

	Required: **No**  
	Type: **string**  
	Accepted Values: **0, 1**  
	Default Values: **1**

	This parameter displays data privacy policy to end-user after the verification process is completed. If the value is set 1, the data privacy policy will be displayed to end-user. If the value is set 0, the data privacy policy will not be displayed. Under the GDPR, we acknowledge the end users right to request for data deletion therefore the default value is 1 but you can set it to 0 if you’ve have another alternative mechanism in place.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
* ## show_results

	Required: **No**  
	Type: **string**  
	Accepted Values: **0, 1**  
	Default Values: **1**

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
* ## face

	The easiest of all verifications is done by authenticating the face of the users. In case of on-site verification, end-user will have to show their face in front of a webcam or camera of their phone that essentially makes it a selfie verification.

	* <h3>allow_offline</h3>

	Required: **No**  
	Type: **string**  
	Accepted Values: **0, 1**  
	Default Values: **1**

# Responses

## Verification Response

The Shufti Pro Verification API will send you two types of responses if a request for verification is made. First is the HTTP response sent against your request, and the second is the callback response. Both HTTP and callback responses will be in the JSON format with header `application/json`. The response header also includes a key Signature. This key is used for validating the source of response. Be sure to validate the request by [generating signature](#response-signature) and matching it with Signature value from the response header.  
Responses will contain the following parameters:

* <h3>reference</h3>
	Your unique request reference, which you provided us at the time of request, so that you can identify the response in relation to the request made.

* <h3>event</h3>
	This is the request event which shows status of request. Event is changed in every response.  

	Please consult [Events](status_codes.md#events) for more information.

* <h3>error</h3>
	Whenever there is an error in your request, this parameter will have the details of that error.

* <h3>token</h3>
	This is the unique request token of the request.

* <h3>verification_url</h3>
	A URL is generated for your customer to verify there documents. It is only generated in case of on-site request.  

* <h3>verification_result</h3>
	It is only returned in case of a valid verification. This includes results of each verification.  

	1 means **accepted**  
	0 means **declined**  
	null means **not processed**  

	Check *verification.accepted* and *verification.declined* responses in [Events](status_codes.md#events) section for a sample response.

	Your unique request reference, which you provided us at the time of request, so that you can identify the response in relation to the request made.

* <h3>event</h3>
	This is the request event which shows status of request. Event is changed in every response.  
	  
	Please consult [Events](status_codes.md#events) for more information.

* <h3>proof</h3>
	This contains all the proofs that were used to verify data. The Proof URLs returned are temporary and valid for **15 minutes only**.

* <h3>verification_data</h3>
	This contains all the data used for verification. This will only be returned in case of `verification.accepted` or `verification.declined`.

* <h3>verification_result</h3>
	This is the complete result of the verification. 1 stands for verified, 0 for not verified and null for no verification performed. This will only be returned in case of `verification.accepted` or `verification.declined`.

* <h3>declined_reason</h3>
	This key will only be returned when event is verification.declined. This will contain the reason why `verification was declined`.

## Delete Request Response

The Shufti Pro Verification API will send a JSON response if a delete request is made. Make sure to validate the request by [generating signature](#response-signature) and matching it with **Signature** value from response header.

* <h3>reference</h3>
	Your unique request reference, which you provided us at the time of request, so that you can identify the response in relation to the request made.

* <h3>event</h3>
	This is the request event which shows status of request. Event is changed in every response.  
	  
	Please consult [Events](status_codes.md#events) for more information.

<aside class="notice">
Note: <b>request.invalid</b> will be returned in case of invalid reference provided or the request is already deleted.
</aside>

>Sample Response  

```json
Content-Type: application/json
  Signature: NmI4NmIyNzNmZjM0ZmNl

{
    "reference": "17374217",
    "event": "request.deleted"
}
```

## Response Signature
Every HTTP and Callback responses will be in application/json with a key **Signature** in the header. It can be used to validate the source of the request. Make a signature using the following procedure:

1. Concatinate Secret Key at the end of the response string. (i.e. response + secret_key).
2. Take **SHA256** of concatinated string.
3. Match the SHA256 string with **Signature** value from the header of the response.

In short, make signature as `hash('sha256', response . your_secret_key)` and match it with the signature provided in the header in **Signature** key.


# HTTP Status Codes and Events

Instant Capture & Verification API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Every response is generated in JSON with a specific HTTP code. Go to [Status Codes](status_codes.md) for a complete list of status codes. Events are sent in responses which show the status of request. These events are sent in both HTTP and callback responses. Please consult [Events](status_codes.md#events) for a complete list of events.
